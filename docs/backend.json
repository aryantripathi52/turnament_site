    "reasoning": "Given the requirement of a Free Fire tournament hosting platform without user login initially, the Firestore structure is designed for simplicity and ease of access, with a focus on displaying tournament information and handling registrations. As the application evolves to include user accounts, the structure will be extended to include user-specific data and authorization mechanisms.\n\nTournaments are stored in a root-level `tournaments` collection. Registrations are stored in a subcollection under each tournament document (`tournaments/{tournamentId}/registrations`). This allows easy querying of registrations for a specific tournament. Announcements and Highlights are stored in root-level collections as they are globally accessible and not directly tied to user accounts or tournaments.\n\n**Authorization Independence and QAPs:**\n\n*   Since there's no initial user login system, authorization is minimal. If security rules are later needed (e.g., to restrict who can create/modify tournaments), ownership or membership models can be introduced.  For example, if certain users should be able to moderate/edit tournaments, an `editors` map could be added to the tournament document with the user ids that can edit the tournament. This map would be duplicated in each `registration` document for Authorization Independence.\n*   QAPs are supported by the segregation of data into collections based on their purpose. `List` operations are inherently secure in this setup, as there are no complex authorization rules to evaluate.\n\nAs the application evolves to include user accounts the following changes will be needed:\n\n*   Introduce a `users` collection to store user profiles and account information.\n*   Update security rules to enforce access control based on user roles and ownership.\n*   Consider using a membership map in the tournament documents to manage collaborators or administrators.\n*   Add indexing for common queries, such as retrieving tournaments by region or date."
